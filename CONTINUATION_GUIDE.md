### **üõ°Ô∏è Critical Security Fix Completed (September 29, 2025)**
**SECURITY DASHBOARD AUTHENTICATION ISSUE RESOLVED:**

**Problem Analysis & Resolution:**
- **Issue Identified**: Frontend components were using inconsistent authentication token handling
  - SecurityDashboard, MFASetup, AI/System/TensorFlow services were looking for `localStorage.getItem('access_token')`
  - AuthContext was storing tokens as `localStorage.getItem('auth_tokens')` (JSON object with access_token, refresh_token, etc.)
  - This mismatch caused "Failed to load security data" errors across security features

- **Comprehensive Fix Applied**: Standardized authentication token handling across all components
  - ‚úÖ SecurityDashboard: Updated to parse auth_tokens JSON and extract access_token
  - ‚úÖ MFASetup Component: Fixed all 3 authentication methods (setup, verification, status)
  - ‚úÖ AI Service: Corrected token retrieval with proper error handling
  - ‚úÖ System Service: Updated authentication with fallback handling
  - ‚úÖ TensorFlow Service: Fixed token parsing for ML operations

**Security Dashboard Now Fully Operational:**
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Security Monitoring**: Live dashboard with current metrics
- ‚úÖ **Security Events Tracking**: 0 events (30 days), 0 high-risk (healthy baseline)
- ‚úÖ **MFA Adoption Monitoring**: 0% adoption (0 of 1 users) - ready for enterprise setup
