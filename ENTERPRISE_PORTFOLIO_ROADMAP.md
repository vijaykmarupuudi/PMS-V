### **🛡️ Security Dashboard Enhancement (September 29, 2025)**
**CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED:**

**Problem Identified & Fixed:**
- ❌ **Root Cause**: Authentication token retrieval mismatch across multiple components
  - SecurityDashboard, MFASetup, and service components were using `localStorage.getItem('access_token')`
  - AuthContext was storing tokens as `localStorage.getItem('auth_tokens')` (JSON object)
  - This caused "Failed to load security data" errors

- ✅ **Resolution Applied**: Standardized authentication token handling across all components
  - Fixed SecurityDashboard authentication to use correct token structure
  - Updated MFASetup component authentication (3 methods fixed)
  - Corrected AI Service, System Service, and TensorFlow Service authentication
  - Verified all security API endpoints functional with proper token handling

**Security Dashboard Now Operational:**
- ✅ Security Events tracking (0 events, 0 high-risk - healthy baseline)
