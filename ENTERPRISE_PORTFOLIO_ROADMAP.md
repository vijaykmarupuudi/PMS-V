  - This caused "Failed to load security data" errors

- ✅ **Resolution Applied**: Standardized authentication token handling across all components
  - Fixed SecurityDashboard authentication to use correct token structure
  - Updated MFASetup component authentication (3 methods fixed)
  - Corrected AI Service, System Service, and TensorFlow Service authentication
  - Verified all security API endpoints functional with proper token handling

**Security Dashboard Now Operational:**
- ✅ Security Events tracking (0 events, 0 high-risk - healthy baseline)
